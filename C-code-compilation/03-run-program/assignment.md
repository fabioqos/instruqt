# Step 3: Run Your Program

First, move back into the directory containing the source code in C with the following command:

```bash
cd /home/C_source
```

Then, if you are running a C program, use GCC to compile and link the source code with the following command:

```bash
gcc helloworld.c -o helloworld
```

If your program is in C++, use this command to compile and link the source code:

```bash
gcc helloworld.cpp -o helloworld
```

Then, modify the permissions on the helloworld executable to allow it to be run with the following command:

```bash
chmod +x helloworld
```

Now, run your program with the following command:

```bash
./helloworld
```
