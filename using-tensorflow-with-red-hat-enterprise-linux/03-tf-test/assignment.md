Run the following command to run a test ML program in Python that has been created for you.

```bash
python3 /home/TF_Source/helloTF.py 2>/dev/null
```

Additionally, if you'd like to view or modify the code, you can do so by opening Vim, a shell-based code editor, by running the following command:

```bash
vim /home/TF_Source/helloTF.py
```
